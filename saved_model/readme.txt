This folder contains the trained machine learning models used for disease prediction in the project "Prediction of Disease Outbreaks Using Machine Learning."

Models Included:
diabetes_model.sav – Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user input parameters.
heart_disease_model.sav – Predicts the risk of heart disease using health-related features.
parkinsons_model.sav – Detects Parkinson’s disease based on voice and movement-related attributes.

Usage Instructions:
These models were trained using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
The models are loaded in the Streamlit web application to generate real-time predictions.
Ensure the models are in the correct directory when running the main application script.

Dependencies:
Python 3.8+
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
